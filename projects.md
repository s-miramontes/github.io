# Selected Projects

## Early Detection of Cognitive Impairment (UCSF EHR)

Used clinical notes and structured EHR data to predict Mild Cognitive Impairment earlier than formal diagnosis using machine learning and NLP. Integrated longitudinal visit-level features and demographics to improve model interpretability.

## Clinical Diagnostic Trajectories

Modeled diagnostic switching patterns (e.g., MCI → Dementia → MCI) using logistic regression and random forests. Explored diagnostic instability and its relationship to comorbidities, clinic type, and sociodemographic factors.

## Social Determinants of Health via Clinical Notes

Used cTAKES to extract mentions of housing and food insecurity from unstructured notes. Refined Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipelines to identify SDOH factors from real-world EHR text data.

## Radiology Report Classification

Built multi-class NLP pipelines to classify organ abnormalities from radiology summaries using Naive Bayes, SVMs, and fine-tuned BERT models. Collaborated with clinicians to improve clinical relevance.

## Longitudinal Cholesterol and Cognitive Decline

Used 14 years of biomarker and memory score data from the Health and Retirement Study. Modeled associations between cholesterol levels and memory decline using longitudinal panel data.
